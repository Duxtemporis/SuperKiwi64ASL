New Super Kiwi 64 Auto Splitter
Most credit goes to CaptinRektbeard for the core of the code.
partial creadit to outlyer for basic Doomsday logic insperation. 
this splitter was abandoned and unupdated after a large update to the game and needed mass reword to make it work with both modes and shifts in level logic.
Crystal tracking was replaced by a memory value tracker which may break. original tracker no longer worked after update and i am too inexpareanced to find a diffrent way to track other than memory.
duxtemporislive on discord if any issues come up.
